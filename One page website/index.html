        This coconut milk poached fish recipe takes inspiration from the flavors of tom kha gai with a few modifications.
        
        
        I simmer the coconut milk with the essential ingredients of ginger, lemongrass, fish sauce, and lime juice, but include garlic and lime zest (in place of makrut lime leaves, which can be difficult to source). Instead of mushrooms, I add bok choy, a popular addition to coconut-based fish recipes that provide vibrant green color and a nice crunch.
        
        Finally, I top the poached fish with lime-pickled chilies for a bit of heat, crispy fried ginger, and fresh cilantro. The dish comes together in just about 30 minutes, perfect for a weeknight meal.<br><br>
        Aromatic Flavors Bring This Dish Together
        Let's delve into some of the key ingredients for flavoring this dish.
        
        <p>Coconut milk serves as the base of the poaching liquid and adds a lightly sweet and nutty flavor to the recipe.</p> My favorite brand is Aroy-D, available online or at most large grocery stores. Its creamy consistency provides a nice contrast to the punchiness of the other ingredients.
        Typically, tom kha gai uses galangal, but gingeris more readily found in the US. Additionally, gingers softer texture is easier to mince for the crispy fried ginger. I like incorporating ginger into this recipe in two ways: first, as an ingredient for the poaching liquid and second, as a crispy topping.
        Lemongrass adds a fragrant, floral flavor to the poaching liquid. Many large grocery stores, including Whole Foods, carry it in the international produce section or herb aisle. If you cannot source it, feel free to omit.
        I use lime zest to add a citrusy component in place of makrut lime leaves, which can be tricky to find. If you do find lime leaves, feel free to substitute the lime zest for two lime leaves. Thinly slice the lime leaves and simmer in the coconut milk as you would the lime zest.
        Fish sauce, a common ingredient in East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines, contributes a rich, savory taste to balance out the creaminess of coconut milk. You only need a little bit to transform a dish.
        How to Purchase and Prep Cod
        I like using cod for this dish because of its accessibility and firm texture (it won't fall apart in the liquid!) A single serving of fish is typically 6 ounces, so I recommend purchasing four (6 ounce) filets for four people. Alternatively, you can buy a large, 1 1/2 pound piece of cod and cut it up into four equal portions.
        
        I typically shop for fish at the seafood section of my local grocery store or a local fish market. Both fresh and frozen fish work for this recipe, though I often use the fresh variety. When shopping for cod, look for a bright, moist appearance and avoid any pieces with fishy odors. For frozen cod, make sure to thaw overnight in the fridge before cooking.
        
        Please note that thicker pieces of cod will take longer to cook through, so you may need to adjust the cooking time based on the size of the fish.
